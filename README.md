Welcome to the Python Challenge project! This assignment involves solving two real-world scenarios using Python scripting: PyBank and PyPoll. Below, you'll find instructions on setting up the project, details about each task, and what you need to deliver.

Background
This project focuses on utilizing Python to analyze financial and election data. You'll be working on two distinct challenges:
- PyBank: Analyzing financial records to calculate key metrics such as total months, total profits/losses, average change, and identifying the greatest increases and decreases in profits.
- PyPoll: Analyzing election data to determine the total number of votes cast, each candidate's total votes and percentage of the total, and identifying the winner based on popular vote.

Before You Begin
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Repository Setup:
- Create a new repository named python-challenge specifically for this project.
- Clone this repository to your local computer.

Folder Structure:
- Inside your cloned repository, create two folders: PyBank and PyPoll.
- Each folder will contain:
    - main.py: This script will be your main analysis script for each assignment.
    - Resources folder: Place the respective CSV file (budget_data.csv for PyBank, election_data.csv for PyPoll) in this folder.
    - Analysis folder: This is where your text file with results will be stored.

Files to Download:
- Download the challenge files from the provided links for PyBank and PyPoll to start your analysis.

Version Control:
- Commit your main.py scripts, CSV files in Resources, and analysis results in Analysis.
- Push your changes to GitHub or GitLab for version control.

Tasks Overview
- For both PyBank and PyPoll, your scripts should accomplish the following:

Read Data:
- Import the CSV file using Python's csv module to read and iterate through the data.

Calculate Metrics:
- For PyBank: Compute total months, net total profits/losses, average change, and identify the greatest increases and decreases in profits.
- For PyPoll: Determine total votes cast, calculate each candidate's total votes and percentage, and determine the winner.

Print Results:
- Print the analysis results to the terminal.

Export Results:
- Export a text file (analysis_results.txt) that includes the analysis summary.

Additional Notes

- Ensure your scripts handle large datasets efficiently by leveraging Python's capabilities for data handling and computation.
- Use appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries) and control structures (loops, conditionals) to iterate through and analyze the data.
- Make use of version control and regular commits to track your progress and prevent data loss.
- Provide clear comments and documentation within your scripts to explain your logic and approach.

Conclusion

By completing PyBank and PyPoll challenges, you'll gain practical experience in using Python for data analysis and reporting, which are essential skills for data-driven decision-making.
